CNT Research Repository Template

Python client and command line tool for Pennsieve (pennsieve2).

# CNT_Development
Development for a template repository for CNT lab. 

The ultimate goal for this tree is to provide the basic structure that each student/researcher can use to ensure their code is part of a pipeline and references shared libraries across groups.

The unit tests folder includes basic unit tests that should be included for pipeline development and code changes.

CNT_research_tools is a submodule of the CNT repository, where lab wide code should live.

sample_data is for anonymized sample data that can be used publicly to test code against. PHI data should not be uploaded to this directort under any circumstances.
