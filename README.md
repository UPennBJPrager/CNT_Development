The purpose of this template is to consolidate shared libraries and enable consistent workflows and tests for most projects in the CNT lab. Users will be able to quickly load code from tested common libraries, or load their own personal code, in an object oriented manner.

# Prerequisites
In order to use this repository, you must have access to either Python or Matlab. 

We also highly recommend the use of a virtual environment, conda environment, or similar software to manage distributions. Examples for their use can be found in the documentation.

# Installation

**or**

pip install foo.tar.gz

where foo is the name of the library of interest.
